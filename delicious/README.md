## How-to

1. Clone all the code and resources to your own workflow directory;
2. Config this workflow in alfred: change the parameters of "USR" and "PASSWD" in the filter script to your delicious username and password;
3. Use keyword **dls** to trigger the workflow;
4. input the query tags and the workflow will automatically get the bookmarks with **all** those tags;

## Afterwords

In the current configuration, this workflow will daily check if there're new bookmarks saved. You may change it to your preference. 

**Be cautious**: When this workflow tries to check the updates or download the bookmarks and tags, especially the first time using, it will bring the results to you very slowly. If nothing shows up, try a second or third time. If you're sure the data have already been updated, maybe there are no bookmarks for that tags combination.
